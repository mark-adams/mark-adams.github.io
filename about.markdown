ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark! By either destiny or chance, you've stumbled upon my blog. This is where I'll write about a variety of topics but most often you'll probably see posts related to information security or software development.

A little background on me for those who are interested. I grew up in cornfields of rural Illinois and moved to Texas during my college years. I've worked a couple different jobs over the years mostly centered around software engineering and eventually cybersecurity. Now, I lead a team of security engineers working on securing team collaboration software at Atlassian.
